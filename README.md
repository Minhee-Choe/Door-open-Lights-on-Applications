# Door-open-Lights-on-Apps
Android and Tizen apps for a smartphone and a smartwatch that sense the door opening motion from the watch and light the flashlight of the smartphone.

This project was for a course named 'software capstone design', and developed in 2017. 
There are two applications 'FlashLights' - Android application written in Java and 'HelloAccel' - Tizen application written in C.
They interact each other via Bluetooth.
